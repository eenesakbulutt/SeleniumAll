Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement?
anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
internal view of the webpage.
Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- Tagname
- xpath
- linktext
- partialLinkText
- CSS Selector
- ClassName

HTML scripting meaning:
purple -- tags
brown -- attributes
blue -- attribute values


Why do we need many locators?
-- some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
-- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
    e.g. linkText and partialLinkText is only used for Links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, Selenium will only interact with the
first element it locates
